# Workload Calculator

This is a simple calculator with the purpose of estimating total operations/sec required for a given workload.
The output of this then provide costs estimates for the workload. Currently this supports DynamoDB cost estimates
with future plans to include databases such as ScyllaDB and others.

This calculator can be seen live at: https://calculator.scylladb.com
